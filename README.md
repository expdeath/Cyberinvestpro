## Getting Started

To run this project, you only need a modern web browser and a Google AI API key.

### 1\. Get a Gemini API Key

You need to generate your own personal API key from Google AI Studio. It's a free and straightforward process.

1.  Visit the **[Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/)** website.
2.  Sign in with your Google account.
3.  Click on **"Get API key"** (usually on the top left).
4.  Click **"Create API key in new project"**.
5.  Copy the generated API key string. **Keep this key private and secure.**

### 2\. How to Run the Application

This application reads the API key from the browser's URL to keep it secure and out of the source code.

1.  Open the `https://expdeath.github.io/Cyberinvestpro/` in your web browser.
2.  In the browser's address bar, append your API key as a query parameter named `apiKey`.

Your final URL should look exactly like this, with your key at the end:

```
https://expdeath.github.io/Cyberinvestpro/?apiKey="YOUR_PERSONAL_API_KEY"
```

## Technical Stack

  * **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JavaScript
  * **AI Engine:** Google Gemini Pro (`gemini-2.5-flash`)
  * **Data Visualization:** Chart.js
  * **Prompt Engineering:** The application relies on highly structured, template-based prompts with a `temperature` of 0 to ensure the AI provides consistent and reliable JSON data.
